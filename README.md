# From this basis:



I will pose a set of questions that help organize theories of data analysis

1- What are the top ten films according to the revenue list?

2- What are the top ten films based on voting?

3- What were the most popularity films during that period 1960-2015 ?!

4- What are the 10 films that have suffered losses throughout history?

5-An analysis of the top five directors movies :( christopher_nolan vs james_cameron )

6- For every dollar spent in the budget, how many profits did he make for directors: ( christopher_nolan vs james_cameron )?

7- What is the most productive film company?

8- What is the total revenue, profit and budget of the most powerful company in the film industry?

9- How many characters have been performed from 1960-2015 ?

10-Who were the 10 actors that earned the most roles?

11- How many movies were made and produced under each genre ?

12- In the years of the new millennium, what is the role of comedy in filmmaking?



# Conclusions:

1-Regarding revenue: In 2009, AVATAR achieved an estimated revenue of 2781505847. Whereas in 2015, "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" achieved second place, if the movie Avatar scored a difference 713327622.

2-In 2010, The Warrior's Way culminated in massive material losses, incurring financial losses of 41,3912,431 It is an estimated loss for every dollar spent from the budget, a profit of about 0.026 cents is obtained

3-The wonderful director christopher_nolan has a visionary eye and a charming touch in filmmaking. With a budget estimated at 150,000,000 in 2005, he was able to achieve profits of 224218673, meaning that every dollar spent was recovered 249%.

4-In 2009, director James_cameron broke the profit barrier in the film industry, managing to set a record high in profits. For every dollar spent in the budget they are returned in profits of 1173% and that's really crazy, Knowing that the lowest percentage of profits recorded was for the 1994 film True Lies, where it was = 329% for every dollar spent, " the profit rate is very high with the rest of the films of the 1990s."

5-The total comedy films that were shot from 1960 to 2015 are 3433 comedy producers, and we notice a leap in the comedy industry in the world of cinema, as from 1960 to 1999 only 1411 previous films were shot. While in the new millennium "2000-2015", 2022 was filmed





# Limitations

In the first step, while reading the data, I noticed a number of missing data. Which may affect the sample, I did not find that the option to fill in the data with the average value is a correct option, as a large number of films will have the same value, which will affect the overall statistics, so I preferred to delete them so that the statistics are more correct.
